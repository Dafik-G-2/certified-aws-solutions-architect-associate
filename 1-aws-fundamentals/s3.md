# Amazon S3

- Amazon S3 is one of the main building blocks of AWS being advertised as "infinitely scaling" storage

## S3 Buckets

- Amazon S3 allows to store objects (files) in "buckets"
- Buckets must have a **globally unique name**
- Buckets are defined at the region level
- Bucket naming conventions:
    - No uppercase
    - No underscore
    - 3-63 character long names
    - Name must no be an IP
    - Must start with a lowercase letter or number

## S3 Objects

- In a bucket an object is a file
- Objects do have a **key** as an identifier, which is basically the full path of the file:
    - s3://my-bucket/**my_file.txt**
    - s3://my-bucket/**my_folder/another_folder/my_file.txt**
- The key is composed of *the prefix* + **object name**
    - s3://my-bucket/*my_folder/another_folder*/**my_file.txt**
- In S3 there is no concept of directories within the buckets, just keys with very long names that contain slashes ("/")
- Object values are the content of the body:
    - Max object size in S3 is 5TB
    - In case of a upload bigger than 5GB, we must use **multi-part upload**
- Each object can have metadata: list of text key/value pairs - system or user added
- Each object can have tags: unicode key/value par, useful for security, lifecycle. A bucket can have up to 10 tags
- If versioning is enabled each object has a version ID
